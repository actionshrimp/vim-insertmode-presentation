On the way to see my friends this afternoon, when
I bumped into a beautiful honey called Cassandra.
She asked me for the time, which I said I would
give her in exchange for a date with me tomorrow
at 9. She accepted. BOSELECTA!

Relaxed during the day and put together some tasty
jams with my good friends the Artful Dodger. Went
for a date in the evening with Cassandra - started
with a bottle of moet for two. Went very well!
Will see her again tomorrow.  BOSELECTA!
