On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (owh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her her name a six digit number, and
A date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Now let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to
Rendevous
She asked me what we were gonna do
said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two

Nine was the time 
cos I'll be getting mine 
and she was looking fine 
Smooth talker 
she told me 
She'd love to unfold me all night long 
Ooh I loved the way she kicked it 
from the front to back she flipped (back she flipped it, ooh the way she kicked it) 
And I oh oh I yeah 
hope that she'd care 
cos I'm a man who'll always be there 

Ooh yeah 
I'm not a man to play around baby 
Ooh yeah 
cos a one night stand isn't really fair 
From the first impression girl hmm you don't seem to be like that 
Cos there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty for that 
From the subway to my home 
endless ringing of my phone 
When you feeling all alone 
all you gotta do 
is just call me call me
